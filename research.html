            <h1>Empathize</h1>
            <p>The idea for Quribana was to take everyday moments when people are in a shared space scrolling through their phones and provide them with a means to connect with one another. Using technology, we can take down some of the barriers that might otherwise prevent the interaction by providing affordances such as anonymity and ephemerality. To help determine just how anonymous these interactions should be to facilitate the interaction and respect the privacy and safety of the user I deployed a survey to understand which features users would want to have in a profile. </p>

        </section>
        <section class="two" style="height: 100vh;">
            <h1>Define</h1>
            <p>Taking this information into consideration I set out to more narrowly define the design to shape the process going forward. Based on the choice of technology to facilitate nearby interactions, I needed to focus on design features that would break the ice in a shared space. This meant focusing on just helping to connect two people that happen to be at the same place and provide any interaction affordances to break down any walls. I needed to brainstorm the user flow that would take two people from matching, to viewing profiles to talking with each other. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="three" style="height: 100vh;">
            <h1>Ideate</h1>
            <p>An initial idea was to have two devices pair and immediately be brought to a chat room. While this flow is quick and simple, it cuts out the important step of viewing the user’s profile to decide if you would like to interact with them or not.</p>
            <img src="img/csimg/sketch.jpg" style="width: 200px;height: auto;margin: 10px;">
            <p>I ultimately decided to move forward with a design that would create a list of all possible connections, with the ability to view the user profile before deciding to interact with them. Rather than instantly connecting two users, they can have the important ability to view some basic information about the user before deciding if they would like to chat with them or not.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="four" style="height: 300vh;">
            <h1>Prototype</h1>
            <img src="img/csimg/flow1.png" style="width: auto;height: 400px;margin: 10px;">
            <p>As a proof of concept and to test the technology, the prototyping began with a low fidelity prototype to facilitate pairing, profile viewing and chatting. After the proof of concept was established, the home page was removed to place the user right into the experience when opening the app.</p>
            <img src="img/csimg/flow2.png" style="width: auto;height: 400px;margin: 10px;">
            <p>The chat page seemed like an opportunity to explore designs in an otherwise overlooked space that often just chooses the chat bubbles that we have all become accustomed to. The conventions we always see, like received messages on the left and three dots when the user is typing, can be redesigned to create an experience that matches the intent of the app.</p>
            <img src="img/csimg/chat2.png" style="width: 200px;height: auto;margin: 10px;">
            <p>An early iteration took the waves used in the branding to create blocks of wave surrounded messages as the messages come in. Most users suggested that the staggering of the messages, as opposed to a list, was too important to the chat to be overlooked.</p>
            <img src="img/csimg/chat3.png" style="width: 200px;height: auto;margin: 10px;">
            <p>The next iteration added staggered messages, resorted to bubbles to help with the contrast but added a unique feature. Only the five most recent messages are displayed. When we are in a real conversation, as the conversation moves on we might forget what someone said a few minutes ago. This design helps mimic a real life conversation. Also, like in real-life, the messages disappear as the more recent ones are displayed, bringing that ephemerality to help users feel safe and comfortable. Moreover, this semantic promotes listening. A user who sends five consecutive messages will actually erase any messages from the second user. The limited screen space promotes pausing to listen to make sure the conversation is two-sided and everyone has a voice. </p>

            <h1>Test</h1>
            <p>User testing was carried out using a think aloud protocol on an Android tablet device paired with my phone. Users were tasked with successfully pairing with my device, viewing my profile and chatting with me. Most of these trials involved hiccups with the connection protocol. The switches on the homepage were not intuitive and did not provide what Don Norman would call “knowledge in the world” to help the user figure out how to connect. This led to the addition of a help page (also informed by a heuristic analysis).</p>
